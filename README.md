# LMU Senior-Project 2017

# Purpose: 
Provide LMU Biology Department with camera system for monitoring the growth of slime mold, 
a simple yet fascinating amoeba. 

# Overview: 
This repository contains the code for Pi camera and user interface. 
The program will periodically take pictures of the slime as it grows and then store the pictures 
to a separate storage location that can be accessed by the Bio department. 

# Additional Info:
As of now the storage service that will be used is the LMU Box cloud server.
Other cloud storage services are being looked into as well. Whichever system is the most compatible with the Pi
will be used (possibly the "mutt" or "mailx" command line tools, which allow the user to send an email with attachment in one line from the linux terminal on the Raspberry Pi).
