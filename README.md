# Senior-Project
#
# Owners: Daniel McGrath and Stephen Board
#
# Purpose: Provide LMU Biology Dept. with camera system for monitoring the growth of slime mold, 
# a simple yet fascinating amoeba.
#
# These programs are used to control a Raspberry Pi camera, which will periodically take pictures 
# of the slime as it grows. 
#
# This repository contains the code for Pi camera and user interface.
