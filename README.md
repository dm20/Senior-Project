*Physarum Polycephalum Plasmodium (Slime Mold)*
### Purpose:
Provide LMU Biology Department with camera system for monitoring the growth of slime mold, 
a simple yet fascinating amoeba.

### Overview: 
This repository contains the code for Pi camera and growth tracking system user interface. 
The program will periodically take pictures of the slime as it grows and then store the pictures 
to a separate storage location that can be accessed by the Bio department lab staff and professors.

### Status:
Currently we are using the Dropbox Python API for developers in order to upload photos
taken by the Pi in real time. We are using the tkinter library for making a GUI.
